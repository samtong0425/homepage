            <h1 class="page-title">On the Shortness of Life</h1>
            <p class="content-box">
                It’s not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste
                much of it. Life is long enough, and it’s been given to us in generous
                measure for accomplishing the greatest things, if the whole of it is
                well invested. But when life is squandered through soft and careless
                living, and when it’s spent on no worthwhile pursuit, death finally
                presses and we realize that the life which we didn’t notice passing
                has passed away.
            </p>

            <p class="content-box">
                All the rest of existence is not living but merely time.
            </p>

            <p class="content-box">
                You’ll find no one willing to distribute
                his money; but to how many people each of us shares out his life!
                Men are thrifty in guarding their private property, but as soon as it
                comes to wasting time, they are most extravagant with the one commodity
                for which it’s respectable to be greedy.
            </p>

            <p class="content-box">
                when your mind
                was free from disturbance; what accomplishment you can claim in
                such a long life; how many have plundered your existence without
                your being aware of what you were losing; how much time has been
                lost to groundless anguish, foolish pleasure, greedy desire, the charms
                of society; how little is left to you from your own store of time. You’ll
                come to realize that you’re dying before your time.
            </p>

            <p class="content-box">
                Who will allow those
                arrangements of yours to proceed according to plan? Are you not
                ashamed to keep for yourself only the remnants of your existence, and
                to allocate to philosophical thought only that portion of time which
                can’t be applied to any business?
            </p>

            <p class="content-box">
                To sum up, everyone agrees that no one area of activity can
                be successfully pursued by someone who is preoccupied—rhetoric
                cannot, nor can the liberal arts—since the distracted mind takes
                in nothing really deeply but rejects everything that is, so to speak,
                pounded into it.
            </p>

            <p class="content-box">
                such a person’s life is extremely long
                because he’s kept available for himself the whole of whatever amount
                of time he had.
            </p>

            <p class="content-box">
                All those who engage you in their business disengage you from yourself.
            </p>

            <p class="content-box">
                But the person who devotes every second of his time to his own needs
                and who organizes each day as if it were a complete life neither longs
                for nor is afraid of the next day.
            </p>

            <p class="content-box">
                you’ll see them ready to spend all they have to stay alive. So great
                is the conflict in their feelings.
            </p>

            <p class="content-box">
                They form their purposes with the distant future in mind. Yet
                the greatest waste of life lies in postponement: it robs us of each day
                in turn, and snatches away the present by promising the future.
            </p>

            <p class="content-box">
                All that’s to come lies in uncertainty: live right now.
            </p>

            <p class="content-box">
                Why are you holding back?” he says. “Why are you slow to action?
                If you don’t seize the day, it slips away.”
            </p>

            <p class="content-box">
                None of these philosophers will force you to die, but all will teach you how.
            </p>

            <p class="content-box">
                There is a common saying that it was not in our power to
                choose the parents we were allotted, and that they were given to us by
                chance; yet we can be born to whomever we wish.
            </p>

            <p class="content-box">
                But for those who forget the past, disregard the present,
                and fear for the future, life is very brief and very troubled.
            </p>

            <p class="content-box">
                But the time of actual enjoyment is short and fleeting, and
                made far shorter by their own fault; for they desert one
                pleasure for another and cannot persist steadily in any one
                desire. Their days aren’t long but hateful; yet, on the other
                hand, how short seem the nights that they spend cavorting with
                prostitutes or drinking!
            </p>

            <p class="content-box">
                Everything that comes our way by chance is unsteady, and the higher
                our fortunes rise, the more susceptible they are to falling.
            </p>

            <p class="content-box">
                Reasons for anxiety will never be wanting, whether because
                of prosperity or wretchedness. Life will be driven on through
                one preoccupation after another; we shall always pray for leisure
                but never attain it.
            </p>

            <p class="content-box">
                The plight of all preoccupied people is wretched, but most
                wretched is the plight of those who labor under preoccupations that are not
                even their own, whose sleep schedule is regulated by somebody else’s,
                who walk at somebody else’s pace, and who are under instructions
                in that freest of all activities—loving and hating.
